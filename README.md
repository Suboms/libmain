# Project Title: Web-Based Online Library Management System
## Project Description

_The Web-Based Online Library Management System is a project that aims to create a digital platform for the efficient management of library operations. This system will provide an easy-to-use interface for librarians to manage library resources, as well as for library patrons to access library materials. The system will feature a web-based interface that allows users to search for books, reserve books, check out books, and return books. The system will also include a database to store information on books, patrons, and library transactions._

    Additionally, the system will allow librarians to manage the library's inventory, track overdue books, and generate reports on library usage. The system will also provide a feature to manage library membership, allowing users to register for a library card online and keep track of their borrowing history.

The system will be built using modern web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. The system will also incorporate security features to ensure the safety of library patrons' personal information.

The Web-Based Online Library Management System will provide a convenient and efficient way for libraries to manage their resources and for patrons to access library materials.
